Applying MVC
============================
CodeFellows > Assignments > Applying MVC

1. Using the MVC design pattern, create a data model for a Post that has userName, title, content, and timeStamp properties
2. Create a Post view which displays the post properties
3. Create a PostsViewController to display a collection of posts
4. Create another controller to create a new post

Challenge

Persist the data somehow between app launches

Use whatever type of data persistence you want (bonus for using NSKeyedArchiver/NSKeyedUnarchiver)
